# gbuckingham89/forest

A package for building WordPress themes. It assumes you're using the  [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) and [ACF PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) plugins.

It provides an object oriented interface for the WordPress functionality that I use the most and extends Timber to provide extra functionality.

**This is very much a work in progress - I don't recommend using it yet - things will change and break.**

*More documentation coming soon.*
